## 📅 Project Timeline  

### **Week 1: Vulnerability Assessment Preparation**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Select and Configure Assessment Tools:  
   - Choose tools such as **Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys**.  
   - Configure them according to the environment being assessed.  
2. Define Scope and Objectives:  
   - Identify which systems, networks, or applications will be assessed.  
   - Set clear assessment goals.  

**Deliverables:**  
- **Tool Configuration Documentation** (settings & rationale).  
- **Assessment Scope Document** (scope & objectives).  

---

### **Week 2: Conduct Vulnerability Assessment**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Perform Vulnerability Scanning on defined scope.  
2. Analyze Scan Results: Review and categorize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact.  

**Deliverables:**  
- **Vulnerability Scan Report** (detailed vulnerabilities with severity ratings).  
- **Initial Analysis Document** (summary of critical vulnerabilities and potential impact).  

---

### **Week 3: Develop Remediation Plan**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Prioritize Vulnerabilities (impact & exploitability).  
2. Create Remediation Strategies with action items.  
3. Document Remediation Plan (timeline & responsibilities).  

**Deliverables:**  
- **Prioritization Report** (risk-based list of vulnerabilities).  
- **Remediation Plan** (detailed fixes & timelines).  

---

### **Week 4: Implement and Verify Fixes**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Apply Remediation Actions.  
2. Verify Fixes & Conduct Follow-up Scans.  
3. Prepare Final Report documenting the entire process.  

**Deliverables:**  
- **Verification Report** (confirmation vulnerabilities were fixed).  
- **Final Remediation Report** (comprehensive report with outcomes).  

---

## 📘 Final Deliverable  
At the end of the project, the team will produce a **comprehensive security report** that includes:  
- Initial vulnerability findings  
- Risk analysis & prioritization  
- Detailed remediation strategies  
- Verification results and outcomes  

---

## 👨‍💻 Tools & Technologies  
- **Nessus**  
- **OpenVAS**  
- **Qualys**  
- **Kali Linux / Security Testing Environment**
