  IR.TEAM



  (Round 3) Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI




Project Overview
This project, developed by IR.TEAM as part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI) - Round 3, focuses on cybersecurity through a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and remediation plan for a target system. Spanning four weeks, it covers preparation, scanning, analysis, remediation, and verification to enhance system security.
Objectives

Identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications.
Prioritize risks based on severity and impact.
Develop and implement actionable remediation strategies.
Verify fixes to ensure robust security.

Technologies Used



Category
Tools/Libraries



Vulnerability Scanning
Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys


Programming

Repository Structure
The repository is organized for clarity and scalability:

/src: Core code (e.g., Python scripts for scanning and analysis).
/docs: Documentation (e.g., reports, user guides).
/tests: Unit tests (e.g., pytest scripts).
/data: Sample data (e.g., mock scan results, no sensitive data).
/assets: Images and logos (e.g., project banner, team logo).
.github/workflows: GitHub Actions for automated testing.
Root Files: README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore.

Branch Management
To maintain a clean workflow:

Use main as the stable branch.
Create feature branches for tasks: git checkout -b feature/week1-prep.
Submit Pull Requests (PRs) to main for review.
Ensure PRs include clear descriptions and pass tests.
Use git rebase for clean history before merging.

GitHub Actions for Automation
Automate testing with GitHub Actions. Create .github/workflows/ci.yml:
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest tests/

This workflow:

Triggers on pushes or PRs to main.
Sets up Python, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
Updates the "Build Passing" badge.
