Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation Plan
 

Overview
This project, developed as a graduation project for the DEPI (Data Engineering and Programming Institute) program, focuses on conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on systems, networks, or applications and formulating a structured remediation plan. The goal is to identify security weaknesses, prioritize them based on risk, and implement effective fixes to enhance system security. This project showcases the integration of cybersecurity practices with data engineering and programming, addressing critical needs in securing digital infrastructures.
Objectives:

Perform thorough vulnerability scans using industry-standard tools.
Develop actionable remediation strategies to mitigate identified risks.
Provide detailed documentation and reports for transparency and compliance.

Importance: In today’s digital landscape, proactive vulnerability management is essential for preventing data breaches, ensuring compliance, and maintaining trust. This project equips users with a repeatable framework for securing systems, making it valuable for both educational and enterprise use.
Features

Tool Integration: Supports leading vulnerability scanners like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.
Structured Workflow: Organized into four phases: preparation, scanning, remediation planning, and verification.
Automated Analysis: Scripts for prioritizing vulnerabilities and generating reports.
Detailed Documentation: Includes scope definitions, scan reports, prioritization lists, and remediation plans.
Extensibility: Modular design allows easy integration of additional tools or custom scripts.
Practical Deliverables: Produces professional reports for each phase, suitable for audits or presentations.

Requirements
To set up and run this project locally, ensure the following:

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended).

Install via: pip install requests pandas reportlab python-dotenv.


Hardware: Minimum 4GB RAM, stable internet for tool downloads and scans.
Permissions: Administrative access for installing tools and running scans.

Installation
Cloning the Repository
Download the project code from GitHub. Replace username/repo with the actual repository path (e.g., yourusername/vulnerability-assessment).
Via HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo

Via SSH:
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
cd repo

Ensure Git is installed (download here). For SSH, configure your keys (GitHub guide).
Setup Instructions

Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install Python Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Install Vulnerability Scanners:

OpenVAS: Follow setup instructions from Greenbone.
Nessus: Download from Tenable and configure using the provided guide.
Update tool configurations in config/tool_config.ini.


Set Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root:
NESSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
TARGET_SYSTEM=192.168.1.1
SCAN_PORTS=1-65535

Load variables using python-dotenv in scripts.

Verify Setup:Run a test script to ensure tools are configured:
python scripts/test_setup.py



Usage
The project follows a four-week workflow, with scripts and documentation for each phase.
Week 1: Vulnerability Assessment Preparation

Task: Define scope and configure tools.
Steps:
Edit docs/scope_document.md to specify target systems (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) and objectives.
Configure tools:python scripts/configure_tools.py --tool openvas --config config/tool_config.ini




Deliverables: Scope document and tool configuration report (docs/tool_config.md).

Week 2: Conduct Vulnerability Assessment

Task: Run scans and analyze results.
Steps:
Perform a scan:python scripts/run_scan.py --tool nessus --target 192.168.1.1 --output reports/scan_report.csv


Analyze results with:import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('reports/scan_report.csv')
critical_vulns = df[df['severity'] == 'Critical']
critical_vulns.to_csv('reports/critical_vulns.csv')




Deliverables: Scan report (reports/scan_report.csv) and analysis summary (docs/initial_analysis.md).

Week 3: Develop Remediation Plan

Task: Prioritize vulnerabilities and create a remediation plan.
Steps:
Prioritize vulnerabilities:python scripts/prioritize_vulns.py --input reports/scan_report.csv --output reports/prioritization_report.md


Document remediation strategies in docs/remediation_plan.md.


Deliverables: Prioritization report and remediation plan.

Week 4: Implement and Verify Fixes

Task: Apply fixes and verify resolution.
Steps:
Implement fixes manually or via scripts in scripts/apply_fixes.py.
Re-scan to verify:python scripts/verify_fixes.py --tool openvas --target 192.168.1.1


Generate final report:python scripts/generate_final_report.py --output reports/final_report.pdf




Deliverables: Verification report (reports/verification_report.md) and final remediation report (reports/final_report.pdf).

For a complete example, run the demo workflow:
bash examples/demo_workflow.sh
